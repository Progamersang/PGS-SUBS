1
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:08,708
<i>Once upon a time,
there was a peaceful kingdom</i>

2
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:12,166
<i>ruled by a virtuous
queen and king.</i>

3
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:15,166
<i>More than anything,
they wished for a child.</i>

4
00:01:16,916 --> 00:01:20,625
<i>One winter's night, a blizzard
swept through their land,</i>

5
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:24,875
<i>blotting out the kingdom in a
bitter storm of snow and ice,</i>

6
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,500
<i>but leaving them a
most precious gift.</i>

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,041
<i>A princess was born.</i>

8
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,500
<i>To honor the night she arrived,</i>

9
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:37,083
<i>her parents named
the girl Snow White.</i>

10
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,708
<i>As she grew, the king and
queen taught Snow White</i>

11
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:46,875
<i>that the bounty of the land
belonged to all who tended it.</i>

12
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:50,458
<i>They showed her how
to rule with love.</i>

13
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:54,666

Hi.

60
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:01,000
<i>The king and
queen watched with pride</i>

61
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:05,208
<i>as Snow White grew into a
kind and fair young princess.</i>

62
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,416
<i>But then, tragedy struck.</i>

63
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,625
<i>Snow White's mother fell ill.</i>

64
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,458
<i>And the Good Queen died.</i>

65
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:25,250
<i>Snow White and the
king were heartbroken.</i>

66
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,791
<i>Until...</i>

67
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,583
<i>an enchanting woman from a far-off
land appeared at the palace.</i>

68
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:50,458
<i>So great was her
beauty that it seemed</i>

69
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,833
<i>to grant her powers
beyond the ordinary.</i>

70
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,375
<i>She married the king,</i>

71
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,125
<i>but she was not
what she appeared.</i>

72
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,583
<i>She was evil</i>

73
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:06,958
<i>and cared only
about her own beauty</i>

74
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:10,333
<i>and the power it granted.</i>

75
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,583
<i>To protect that power,</i>

76
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,833
<i>she kept a magic mirror</i>

77
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:19,291
<i>which could answer but
one simple question.</i>

78
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:22,125
Magic Mirror on the wall,

79
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:26,541
who is the fairest of them all?

80
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:29,875
You, my Queen,

81
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:33,416
of all the women reckoned fair,

82
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,083
your beauty is beyond compare.

83
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:41,500
<i>The new queen
wasted no time seizing power.</i>

84
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:46,083
<i>She warned of a terrible threat
from beyond the Southern Kingdom.</i>

85
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,916
<i>So the Good King swore
to defend his people.</i>

86
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:52,625
♪ <i>Hold it close</i> ♪

87
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:56,375
♪ <i>Til I return to you</i> ♪

88
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:08,375
<i>But the
king did not return.</i>

89
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,333
<i>Fear gripped the kingdom.</i>

90
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:17,000
<i>And the queen's power grew.</i>

91
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,333
<i>She turned the
farmers into soldiers</i>

92
00:07:21,416 --> 00:07:23,000
<i>loyal only to her,</i>

93
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:26,916
<i>and robbed the riches of
the kingdom for herself.</i>

94
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,625
<i>She made Snow White a servant</i>

95
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,208
<i>and locked her away
behind the castle walls.</i>

96
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:40,166
<i>But as long as the mirror answered the
queen each day that she was the fairest,</i>

97
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,958

the queen's cruel jealousy.</i>

Hello?

112
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,041
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:56,143
Is there something
I can help you with?

114
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,458
That's okay. Just browsing.

115
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,458
Well, I'm going to have to
ask you to put those back.

116
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:06,083
I would, but it seems like
the queen has plenty already.

117
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:09,375
Oh, I see. So that's
your excuse for stealing?

118
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:12,166
My friends are hungry. I'm
hungry. That's my excuse.

119
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:16,291
Maybe I can speak
with the queen.

120
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:21,101
You really think the people upstairs
want to share with people like us?

121
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,125
Well, the princess would.

122
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:23,666
Snow White.

123
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,416
Snow White hasn't been seen
or heard from in many years.

124
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,100
I doubt she'll be of
any help to anyone.

125
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,125
All she does is think of
how to help her people.

126
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,250
Well, then you should let
her know, at some point,

127
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,083
it might be useful for
her to stop thinking.

128
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,583
Maybe start doing.

129
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:41,625
There's an intruder
in the castle. Seal the doors!

130
00:09:42,125 --> 00:09:43,125
Take some for yourself.

131
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,000
And share the rest
with your princess.

132
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,083
Maybe no one else
has even told her.

133
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:56,708
I'm sure if the queen was aware of
how desperate things have gotten,

134
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:58,458
she would be happy to share.

135
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,791
I at least have to try,

136
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,333
even if it is just a wish.

137
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,875
Wish... Wish...

138
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:11,708
Wish...

139
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,833
Snow White, have you
finished your chores?

140
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:20,250
Yes, Your Majesty.

141
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:22,875
It's important we
all do our share.

142
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:25,583
Well, that's what I came to
speak to you about, actually.

143
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,250
Sharing.

144
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:38,958
Please.

145
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,208
You were saying?

146
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:43,625
It's just...

147
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:45,708
Your Majesty,

148
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,791
people are struggling,
and it may not be much,

149
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:53,458
but when I was young, my
parents and I would pick apples.

150
00:10:53,541 --> 00:10:54,833
We'd take them and make pies,

151
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,750
- then go out into the village...
- Pies?

152
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:59,791
Pies are luxuries. They
don't need luxuries.

153
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:01,833
It confuses them.

154
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:05,666
But sometimes something
small, something sweet even,

155
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:09,458
can make you believe that there's more
to being alive than mere subsistence.

156
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,541
You know, I really don't
remember you being this...

157
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:15,458
opinionated.

158
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,041
My apologies. It's just...

159
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:21,333
I feel they need some kindness.

160
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:32,583
"Fearless, fair, brave, true."

161
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,375
How quaint.

162
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:40,458
One day, you'll understand
how useless those words are.

163
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,208
But in the meantime,

164
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,416
here's a tidbit for you.

165
00:11:47,125 --> 00:11:48,291
Observe.

166
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,833
Ravishing, isn't it?

167
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:53,958
Yes, Your Majesty.

168
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,125
One is weak, useless, fragile.

169
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:03,333
The other hard, unyielding,

170
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:05,750
everlasting, flawless,

171
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,583
beautiful.

172
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,958
My subjects don't want a flower.

173
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,208
They want a diamond.

174
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,375
- Your Highness...
- Get your hands off me!

175
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:22,416
...this criminal was caught in the
scullery pilfering royal supplies.

176
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,791
That's a lie.

177
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,875
Are you one of the bandits

178
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,708
that gather in the forest
stealing in the name of the king?

179
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,166
No, no, Your Majesty.

180
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,000
Not "one of the
bandits." I'm the boss.

181
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,750
Loyal to the one true king.

182
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,833
Find his home and
burn it to the ground.

183
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,541
Funny thing is,

184
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:49,684
I don't actually have a home.

185
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:51,416
Then take him to the dungeon.

186
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,250
- Fill the castle with his cries.
- Your Majesty...

187
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:58,250
I understand the
need for justice.

188
00:12:58,333 --> 00:12:59,750
But please, this isn't fair.

189
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,375
What did you say?

190
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:11,958
The punishment must
not exceed the crime,

191
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,778
- and I know my father would...
- Your father?

192
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:16,666
Your father?

193
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,500
My father would show mercy.

194
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,916
I'm sorry, my
dear. You're right.

195
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:31,458
This thief stole from me.

196
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:34,000
So, I will steal from him.

197
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:37,291
Remove his coat and boots and
bind him to the gates to freeze.

198
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:38,851
You know, is the
dungeon still an option?

199
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:40,333
Take him away!

200
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:42,666
Wait, he'll perish.
Please, Your Majesty.

201
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,750
Snow White!

202
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:45,750
Here...

203
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:48,125
look at yourself.

204
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,625
Isn't this what you want?

205
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:52,916
Go on,

206
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
speak to your people.

207
00:13:56,666 --> 00:13:58,875
Your subjects await
you, Snow White.

208
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:03,125
Your pies and your wise words.

209
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:05,583
What will you tell them, hmm?

210
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,750
That you've made them dessert?

211
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:12,083
You live in a world of wishes.

212
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,708

for I see

303
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:34,333
she is more fair than thee.

304
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:35,416
No!

305
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:38,833
Huntsman?

306
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,541
Your Majesty.

307
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:42,875
Take Snow White far
into the forest.

308
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:46,916
Find a secluded glade
where she can pick apples,

309
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,416
and there,

310
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,958
my faithful Huntsman,

311
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:53,916
kill her.

312
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:55,833
But,

313
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:57,750
Majesty,

314
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,500
she's just a girl.

315
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:02,458
And I'm your queen.

316
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:05,916
It was Snow White who
set the bandit free.

317
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,875
She's plotting against me.

318
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:10,750
Now, tell me,

319
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,416
are you against me, too?

320
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,750
Are you? Yes or no?

321
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:19,416
No,

322
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:20,916
Majesty.

323
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,375
Take
her to the forest.

324
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,166
Kill her.

325
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,666
Cut out her heart.

326
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,416
Put it in this box.

327
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,333
On your return,

328
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:42,291
you will have anything
your heart desires.

329
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,125
Would you like one?

330
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,250
You're very kind.

331
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:26,791
It's getting late.

332
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:47,166
Why?

333
00:22:49,583 --> 00:22:50,583
Why?

334
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,416
You must flee into the woods.

335
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,017
The queen is mad.
She'll stop at nothing.

336
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:05,375
I can't leave the kingdom.

337
00:23:05,458 --> 00:23:07,125
She is evil, child.

338
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:08,833
She's a liar.

339
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:12,041
You were never told the
truth about your father.

340
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:13,916
Go!

341
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:17,250

437
00:32:07,416 --> 00:32:10,416
It is indeed exceptional to
be back at our place of habitation.

438
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,140
Is it me or
is it dusty in here?

439
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:13,875
It's you.

440
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:19,506
Can't wait to floss.

443
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:32,333
What?

444
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:33,583
He did it again.

445
00:32:33,666 --> 00:32:34,750
Narcoleptic cataplexy.

446
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:36,750
I thought he just...

447
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:38,166
fell asleep when he was worried.

448
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:40,250
What's there to
be worried about?

449
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,708
Time to worry!

450
00:32:46,375 --> 00:32:47,495
Barricade the door!

451
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,416
Guys, where's Dopey?

452
00:32:58,208 --> 00:32:59,208
Don't move.

453
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:00,500
Ogres smell fear.

454
00:33:00,583 --> 00:33:02,375
It's not an
ogre. It's a phantasm.

455
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:03,601
Should he
crouch and hide?

456
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:05,000
Or make himself big and roar?

457
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,416
Depends what kind of ogre.

458
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,625
It's not an ogre!

459
00:33:07,708 --> 00:33:08,833
It's a demon goat.

460
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:10,226
Don't look
it in the eyes.

461
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:11,791
If you see ectoplasm,

462
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:13,958
- don't touch it.
- Is it floating?

463
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:15,541
Be careful, Dopey.

464
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:53,833
Don't be afraid.

465
00:33:56,958 --> 00:33:58,125
It's all right.

466
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:03,291
I only wanted to meet you.

467
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:08,666
What's your name?

468
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:13,541
Don't you speak?

469
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:15,375
Let's take
back our friend!

470
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,041
Wait, wait. Please.

471
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:20,833
- Why...
- It's a human.

472
00:34:21,416 --> 00:34:23,208
Well, yes. What did
you think I was?

473
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:24,333
- Nothing.
- Ghost.

474
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:26,809
- But where did you come from?
- Are you hungry?

475
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:27,916
Can we be friends?

476
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,125
What's your name?

477
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:30,642
Why is everyone
being so cordial?

478
00:34:30,666 --> 00:34:33,875
The only human things that come
into the forest anymore are bandits

479
00:34:33,958 --> 00:34:36,833
- who claim to fight in the king's name.
- What?

480
00:34:36,916 --> 00:34:39,333
You're in trouble with
the law, aren't ya?

481
00:34:40,875 --> 00:34:41,791
Hmm?

482
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:43,458
- I'd better go.
- Told ya.

483
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:45,767
- No, no, no. Wait, wait. Hold on.
- Let her leave.

484
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:47,958
Well, at least tell
us who you are.

485
00:34:48,041 --> 00:34:49,166
- Yeah.
- Yes.

486
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:50,916
My name is Snow White.

487
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:56,416
- Snow White?
- The princess?

488
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,583
I say it's a trap.

489
00:34:57,666 --> 00:34:58,666
But she needs our help.

490
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:01,976
- Anyone still think she's a ghost?
- Wait, wait, wait. Where are you going?

491
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,041
As far away from the
castle as possible.

492
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:06,125
- That's not good enough.
- But why?

493
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:11,458
The truth is, the
queen tried to kill me.

494
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:13,958
She really tried to kill you?

495
00:35:14,041 --> 00:35:15,291
Well, that's terrible.

496
00:35:15,375 --> 00:35:18,208
It's also exactly why
you have to leave.

497
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:20,642
You should stay here until you
figure out where you're gonna go.

498
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:23,000
- What?
- I think that's a wonderful idea.

499
00:35:23,083 --> 00:35:24,083
Now, hold on.

500
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:26,541
A human shows up in this
cottage for the first time

501
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:27,958
in 275 years

502
00:35:28,041 --> 00:35:29,416
and you ask her to stay?

503
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,000
Did he just say

504
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:32,791
275 years?

505
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:35,500
274, to be precise.

506
00:35:35,583 --> 00:35:37,250
We're as old as the trees.

507
00:35:37,791 --> 00:35:40,416
My parents always said this
forest was a magical place.

508
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,458
And I've always said that humans
cause nothing but trouble.

509
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,125
I'm sorry. I don't
know your name.

510
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:48,750
Allow me to introduce
in alphabetical order.

511
00:35:48,833 --> 00:35:50,458
Bashful. Dopey.

512
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:52,000
Grumpy. Happy.

513
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,458
Sleepy. Sneezy.

514
00:35:53,541 --> 00:35:54,916
And I'm Doc.

515
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,875
You said we were doing reverse
alphabetical order this time.

516
00:35:57,958 --> 00:35:59,333
That was last time.

517
00:35:59,416 --> 00:36:00,875
So, in reverse order,

518
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:03,875
it's Sneezy, Sleepy, Happy,
Grumpy, Dopey, Doc, and Bashful.

519
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:05,666
Well, I'll be.

520
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:07,166
How did she do that?

521
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,958
My mother always taught me that
it was important to learn a name.

522
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:12,458
Well, in order of the longest
toes to the shortest toes,

523
00:36:12,541 --> 00:36:13,916
I have the longest toes.

524
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,750
If that helps.

525
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:20,333
And what exactly do you
do out here in the forest?

526
00:36:20,416 --> 00:36:23,416
Oh. Well, it's our
job to mine the mines.

527
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,083
You'd be amazed at
what you can find.

528
00:36:25,166 --> 00:36:27,000
Sparkling rocks of every kind.

529
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:28,541
A place where
magic still abides.

530
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:30,666
Not for long if she resides!

531
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,166
Look at the time.

532
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:38,458
The important thing is that Snow White
is out of harm's way at our address.

533
00:36:38,541 --> 00:36:39,833
- Right, fellas?
- Yeah.

534
00:36:40,208 --> 00:36:41,583
- Absolutely.
- Objection.

535
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,500
Noted. Just ignore him.

536
00:36:49,625 --> 00:36:51,083
Maybe I'll just
stay for one night.

537
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:52,958
One night. Then she leaves.

538
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:55,333
- You can come here.
- What size are your slippers?

539
00:36:55,416 --> 00:36:57,791
- I love slumber parties.
- We got some spare upstairs.

540
00:36:57,875 --> 00:36:59,750
You'll be safe
from the queen here.

541
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:10,083
Magic Mirror on the wall,

542
00:37:10,875 --> 00:37:14,375
who's the fairest one of all?

543
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:17,416
Far beyond the castle wall,

544
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,250
somewhere in the woods dwells

545
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:22,708
Snow White,

546
00:37:22,791 --> 00:37:24,916
fairest one of all.

547
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,916
No.

548
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,833
I am only bound by what is true.

549
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:31,333
The fairest lives.

550
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:33,916

It's the morning,
and she's still here.

618
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:11,750
They'll come looking for her,

619
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:14,041
and when they find her...

620
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:17,791
What do you have
to say about that?

621
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:20,500
Now, Grumpy, you know Dopey doesn't talk.

622
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:21,625
Because he's a dope!

623
00:41:21,708 --> 00:41:23,708
Just because his name is Dopey

624
00:41:23,791 --> 00:41:26,208
doesn't mean he's
actually a dope.

625
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:28,375
Of course that's the reason.

626
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:31,500
Same as how you're called
Happy because you're happy.

627
00:41:31,583 --> 00:41:34,541
And I'm called Grumpy
because I'm... I'm...

628
00:41:35,333 --> 00:41:36,625
misunderstood.

629
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,291
Ow!

630
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,708
Shish kebabs!

631
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:44,625
Huh?

632
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:47,125
Here you go.

633
00:41:47,208 --> 00:41:48,541
Hey!

634
00:41:48,625 --> 00:41:51,291
Guys, let's all just
try to be friends.

635
00:41:54,041 --> 00:41:55,666
Ow. Stop.

636
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,500
Hey! Yippee ki-yay!

637
00:42:00,625 --> 00:42:02,291
- You're toast, mister!
- Aha!

638
00:42:04,458 --> 00:42:05,291
Come here!

639
00:42:05,375 --> 00:42:06,666
Settle down.

640
00:42:07,458 --> 00:42:09,083
I'm gonna
get your long toe!

641
00:42:09,166 --> 00:42:10,583
Grumpy, that tickles!

642
00:42:11,875 --> 00:42:13,291
Oh...

643
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,958
- Oh, my foot!
- Huh?

644
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:19,750
Oh, no!

645
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:22,000
Pepper!

646
00:42:22,083 --> 00:42:24,458
He's gonna blow.

647
00:42:24,541 --> 00:42:25,541
Achoo!

648
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:37,583
Dopey,

649
00:42:37,666 --> 00:42:39,500
breakfast is supposed
to go in your mouth.

650
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:42,083
Not on your head!

651
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,750
Isn't life gruel?

652
00:42:44,833 --> 00:42:46,333
You get it? Gruel!

653
00:42:59,583 --> 00:43:01,166
Are you all right?

654
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:06,583
Makes you want to run and hide.

655
00:43:11,666 --> 00:43:13,333
Are you afraid to speak?

656
00:43:16,708 --> 00:43:17,708
Oh.

657
00:43:20,416 --> 00:43:22,791
Well, then, maybe we can
start with something small.

658
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:25,583
When I was a little girl, my
mother taught me how to whistle.

659
00:43:25,666 --> 00:43:29,250
So, even when I'm afraid
to speak, I whistle.

660
00:43:29,333 --> 00:43:31,541
Because when you whistle,
it's your heart singing.

661
00:43:31,625 --> 00:43:32,625
And that voice,

662
00:43:33,541 --> 00:43:35,708
the one that's
hidden in your heart,

663
00:43:35,791 --> 00:43:37,041
can be heard.

664
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:44,166
See? Now you try.

665
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:55,916
Well, just enough to
make a candle flicker.

666
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Not go out.

667
00:44:15,833 --> 00:44:17,083
You did it.

668
00:44:18,916 --> 00:44:20,375
I knew you could.

669
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Come on.

670
00:44:25,208 --> 00:44:27,166
Hey! Come here.

671
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:29,708
Give it back!

672
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:32,833
I got it.

673
00:44:37,291 --> 00:44:40,416
What's that divine
and ravishing noise?

674
00:44:41,291 --> 00:44:43,250
Did a songbird
come through a window?

675
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:44,666
It's Dopey.

676
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:46,458
He sounds
like a baby angel.

677
00:44:46,541 --> 00:44:47,708
It's a trick.

678
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:48,791
It's not a trick.

679
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:51,083
How are you doing that?

680
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:52,892
Well, you
put your lips together,

681
00:44:52,916 --> 00:44:55,541
place your tongue behind
your teeth and whistle.

682
00:44:55,625 --> 00:44:58,666
That's easy.

683
00:45:04,916 --> 00:45:07,541
Is this normal, or just
something you do among friends?

684
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:08,833
We're not friends.

685
00:45:08,916 --> 00:45:11,375
275 years is a
long time to argue.

686
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,041
274.

687
00:45:13,125 --> 00:45:14,125
Leave me out of it.

688
00:45:14,166 --> 00:45:16,541
- I'm the only sensible one here.
- Oh.

689
00:45:16,625 --> 00:45:18,833
And you feel like they're
not listening to sense?

690
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:20,000
Correct.

691
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:21,791
I take your point, Mr. Grumpy.

692
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:24,000
You... Wait.

693
00:45:25,916 --> 00:45:26,916
What?

694
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,083
Well, it seems to me
that everyone here

695
00:45:29,166 --> 00:45:31,500
could do a much better job
at listening to one another.

696
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:43,916
I was thinking the same thing.

697
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Hey.

698
00:45:45,083 --> 00:45:47,184
Uh, Miss White, I
wouldn't look in there if I...

699
00:45:47,208 --> 00:45:49,125
She's really
making herself at home.

700
00:45:49,208 --> 00:45:50,625
I don't remember those.

701
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:53,208
Now you wash the dishes.

702
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:55,750
You tidy up the room.

703
00:45:55,833 --> 00:45:57,416
- Okay.
- Come on.

704
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,208
You clean those cobwebs.

705
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:02,625
And he'll use

706
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:04,000
the broom.

707
00:46:04,083 --> 00:46:05,333

Well, when I was a little
girl, every day was like this.

756
00:49:02,583 --> 00:49:03,791
Every day?

757
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:05,166
Every day.

758
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:09,416
When my father was king.

759
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,250
Oh.

760
00:49:12,041 --> 00:49:15,041
The Huntsman said the
queen lied about my father.

761
00:49:15,125 --> 00:49:16,708
She lied about everything.

762
00:49:17,666 --> 00:49:19,250
What if he's still alive?

763
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,333
I have to find him.

764
00:49:24,041 --> 00:49:25,875
You said that there were
bandits in the forest

765
00:49:25,958 --> 00:49:27,434
who claimed to fight
in the king's name.

766
00:49:27,458 --> 00:49:28,458
Human criminals.

767
00:49:28,541 --> 00:49:30,375
Those rebels are
nothing but thieves.

768
00:49:30,458 --> 00:49:32,333
They're actually a band
of erstwhile actors

769
00:49:32,416 --> 00:49:34,333
whose sustenance
was made unstable

770
00:49:34,416 --> 00:49:36,500
by the queen's greedy
economic policies

771
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:38,208
which forced them
into a liminal space

772
00:49:38,291 --> 00:49:40,208
where ethics and
motives are ill-defined.

773
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:42,375
Well, where are they?

774
00:49:43,041 --> 00:49:45,583
If they know the truth about
my father, I need to find them.

775
00:49:45,666 --> 00:49:47,125
Oh, no. I advise against it.

776
00:49:47,208 --> 00:49:48,500
It's too dangerous.

777
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:49,625
Stay with me.

778
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:52,291
I mean, us.

779
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:56,166
Yeah. You barely got away from
the queen the last time.

780
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:57,250
Gesundheit.

781
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:00,000
But this is what I have to do.

782
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:02,250
Besides, Grumpy's right.

783
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:05,333
The longer I stay here with you,
the more danger I put you in.

784
00:50:05,416 --> 00:50:07,000
At last.

785
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:09,500
- Goodbye.
- Grumpy!

786
00:50:09,583 --> 00:50:10,583
No.

787
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,875
It's time for me to stop hiding.

788
00:50:12,958 --> 00:50:15,208
Thank you all for
showing me such kindness.

789
00:50:15,291 --> 00:50:16,291
No, wait a minute.

790
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:17,583
Even you, Grumpy.

791
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:19,625
Now,

792
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:21,308
can you point me in
the right direction?

793
00:50:22,291 --> 00:50:24,458
We're late for work!

794
00:50:24,541 --> 00:50:25,684
Come on, everybody.
I need you to...

795
00:50:25,708 --> 00:50:27,250
I'll get the snacks.

796
00:50:27,333 --> 00:50:29,125
Come on, Sleepy. Hello?

797
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:43,125
Don't say a word.

798
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:44,750
You.

799
00:51:45,583 --> 00:51:48,041
If we go this way, we'll link
up with the other riders.

800
00:51:52,666 --> 00:51:54,958
And when I told you to come
see what it was like out here,

801
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:57,309
didn't expect you to bring half
the palace guards with you.

802
00:51:57,333 --> 00:51:59,166
I didn't exactly invite them.

803
00:51:59,666 --> 00:52:01,083
I had no choice but to run.

804
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:03,208
The queen wants me dead.

805
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Come on.

806
00:52:09,416 --> 00:52:11,000
I'm actually looking
for my father.

807
00:52:11,083 --> 00:52:13,083
I was hoping you might
be able to help me.

808
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:15,541
You're loyal to
the one true king.

809
00:52:17,916 --> 00:52:18,916
Right.

810
00:52:19,708 --> 00:52:21,166
Absolutely.

811
00:52:21,250 --> 00:52:22,250
We, uh...

812
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:25,000
We hear rumors, whispers.

813
00:52:25,875 --> 00:52:29,166
Some people say he was taken prisoner
in the Southern Kingdom, but...

814
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:31,083
You have no idea where he is.

815
00:52:31,916 --> 00:52:33,250
I'm so sorry to disappoint.

816
00:52:34,125 --> 00:52:36,458
You must have mistaken me for
a knight in shining armor.

817
00:52:37,583 --> 00:52:39,750
I don't think anyone's
making that mistake.

818
00:52:40,333 --> 00:52:42,291
I was hoping you
might know something.

819
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:43,375
Oh, of course.

820
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,726
Princesses are always waiting for a
prince to show up or a king to come back.

821
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:51,083
My father is the only person who can
restore this kingdom to what it once was.

822
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:53,000
A little late for
that, I'm afraid.

823
00:52:53,083 --> 00:52:55,541
Obviously, you've forgotten
how things used to be,

824
00:52:55,625 --> 00:52:58,416
when people were kind and fair.

825
00:53:00,291 --> 00:53:01,517
I wish I had time
for things like

826
00:53:01,541 --> 00:53:03,541
kindness and fairness.

827
00:53:04,916 --> 00:53:06,250

You're in the presence of the rebel
Quigg, master of the crossbow.

877

Hands up!

878
00:55:20,208 --> 00:55:22,541
Step away from our captain.

879
00:55:22,625 --> 00:55:24,250
And no harm will come to you.

880
00:55:30,458 --> 00:55:32,416
You don't have a crossbow.

881
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,440
- It was stolen.
- It's okay.

882
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:37,250
She's with me.

883
00:55:37,958 --> 00:55:38,958
Captain?

884
00:55:39,541 --> 00:55:40,708
And my associates.

885
00:55:41,875 --> 00:55:43,000
Loyal to the king?

886
00:55:44,333 --> 00:55:45,750
You're just a common criminal.

887
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:47,500
My name's Jonathan, Princess.

888
00:55:50,791 --> 00:55:52,166
Not "Jonathan Princess."

889
00:55:52,583 --> 00:55:53,583
Just "Jonathan..."

890
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Princess.

891
00:55:58,208 --> 00:55:59,208

It's the palace guards.

903
00:56:33,083 --> 00:56:34,625
Two soldiers for
every one of us.

904
00:56:34,708 --> 00:56:37,250
We are searching for
the Princess Snow White.

905
00:56:37,333 --> 00:56:38,458
You have to run, Princess.

906
00:56:38,541 --> 00:56:39,541
What about all of you?

907
00:56:39,625 --> 00:56:41,541
Don't worry about us.
We'll hold them off.

908
00:56:41,625 --> 00:56:43,625
- I'll fight with you.
- I'm not asking.

909
00:56:43,708 --> 00:56:44,791
I'm making it a fair fight.

910
00:56:44,875 --> 00:56:47,083
Yeah, the thing is,
I don't fight fair.

911
00:56:49,708 --> 00:56:50,750
Don't shoot!

912
00:56:51,333 --> 00:56:53,125
We can tell you where
the princess is.

913
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:08,166
Now.

914
00:57:23,291 --> 00:57:24,291
I can't leave.

915
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:26,495
I'm going to need your help.

916
00:57:53,708 --> 00:57:54,958
Last chance, bandits.

917
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,625
Tell us what you
know of Snow White.

918
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:00,458
You seek Snow White?

919
00:58:01,666 --> 00:58:02,916
I'm over here.

920
00:58:05,166 --> 00:58:06,166
This way.

921
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:10,208
- Go!
- Move!

922
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,375
Spread out!

923
00:58:35,166 --> 00:58:36,875
Spread out. Find them.

924
00:58:36,958 --> 00:58:37,958
Yes, sir!

925
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:42,375
Where's my horse?

926
00:58:51,041 --> 00:58:52,041
Go, go.

927
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:55,083
You came back.

928
00:58:55,166 --> 00:58:57,583
Someone had to solve
your princess problem.

929
00:58:57,666 --> 00:58:58,916
I told you I'd fight with you.

930
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,333
- I guess you meant it.
- I guess so.

931
00:59:03,083 --> 00:59:04,375
You continue to impress me.

932
00:59:04,458 --> 00:59:06,000
Oh, thank you.

933
00:59:06,083 --> 00:59:09,916
Compliment like that coming from a
criminal mastermind like yourself.

934
00:59:13,583 --> 00:59:14,833
Make sure we lost them.

935
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:21,250
The people,

936
00:59:21,750 --> 00:59:23,416
they've forgotten
how it used to be.

937
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:26,458
And they despise the
queen. But they're afraid.

938
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:30,471
That's why we fight
in your father's name.

939
00:59:33,291 --> 00:59:34,891
Your parents weren't
afraid of anything.

940
00:59:36,708 --> 00:59:38,416
They made us all
feel a little braver.

941
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:43,875
They gave everyone hope.

942
00:59:56,208 --> 00:59:58,309
Now, we'll cut
through to the glen a mile south.

943
00:59:58,333 --> 01:00:00,166
We need to cover our tracks.

944
01:00:15,375 --> 01:00:17,309
- Jonathan?
- What was that?

945
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:18,684
Oh, no.

946
01:00:18,708 --> 01:00:21,041
I think we have a bit
of a problem, Princess.

947
01:00:21,416 --> 01:00:23,096
He's
going to need a doctor.

948
01:00:23,541 --> 01:00:26,666
Doc is more of a sobriquet
rather than a technical title

949
01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:28,458
as my true expertise lies

950
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:31,708
in the study of igneous, sedimentary,
and metamorphic granules.

951
01:00:32,208 --> 01:00:34,375
You know, rocks.

952
01:00:34,458 --> 01:00:35,750
Oh!

953
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:38,625
I am the rebel Quigg,

954
01:00:38,708 --> 01:00:40,416
master of the crossbow,

955
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:42,000
and I'm ordering
you to save him.

956
01:00:42,083 --> 01:00:44,791
Oh, we haven't even been introduced yet.

957
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:46,809
- In alphabetical order...
- Doc, please, we don't have time.

958
01:00:46,833 --> 01:00:48,309
He's badly injured.
You have to help.

959
01:00:48,333 --> 01:00:49,750
But they're bandits!

960
01:00:49,833 --> 01:00:51,767
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Come here, you.

961
01:00:54,666 --> 01:00:56,916
This is exactly how the queen
would want us to behave.

962
01:00:57,416 --> 01:00:58,541
Fighting with each other,

963
01:00:59,291 --> 01:01:02,166
distrusting each other.
This is how she wins!

964
01:01:02,916 --> 01:01:06,291
She's poisoned everyone into believing
that it's everyone for themselves.

965
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:10,708
But if...

966
01:01:11,666 --> 01:01:13,833
we can give up
our meager scraps,

967
01:01:14,875 --> 01:01:17,541
we will inherit what
was meant for all of us.

968
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:21,708
And it's more than
any of us can imagine.

969
01:01:22,875 --> 01:01:23,875
It just...

970
01:01:25,083 --> 01:01:27,625
requires faith in each other.

971
01:01:28,166 --> 01:01:29,166
Mmm.

972
01:01:31,166 --> 01:01:32,375
Now help him.

973
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,666
Please.

974
01:01:37,833 --> 01:01:38,833
Hmm.

975
01:01:42,208 --> 01:01:43,375
Bring him inside.

976
01:01:46,208 --> 01:01:47,208
Hot milk.

977
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:50,666
It helps me sleep.

978
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:51,750
Thank you.

979
01:01:59,166 --> 01:02:02,083
I used the blast furnace
to cut through the bedrock,

980
01:02:02,166 --> 01:02:04,083
then drilled to
the fissure core,

981
01:02:04,166 --> 01:02:06,083
added a poultice or two.

982
01:02:06,166 --> 01:02:08,500
A dose of acetum saturninum,

983
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:10,833
acid of sulfur dulcified.

984
01:02:10,916 --> 01:02:13,666
Uh...

985
01:02:20,791 --> 01:02:22,166
- Oh, oh!
- That was...

986
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:23,250
Huh.

987
01:02:25,083 --> 01:02:26,726
- ...unpleasant.
- You did it, Doc.

988
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:27,750
I thought he was dead.

989
01:02:31,458 --> 01:02:33,958
Hey.

990
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:40,708
- Thank you, Doc.
- Of course.

991
01:02:40,791 --> 01:02:44,125
I would do anything for
Snow White's special friend.

992
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:46,333
- Ooh! You got a special friend.
- Oh, no.

993
01:02:46,416 --> 01:02:48,125
- No.
- Oh.

994
01:02:48,208 --> 01:02:49,351
- No. No.
- What?

995
01:02:49,375 --> 01:02:51,517
- I would have brought anyone here to...
- Exactly.

996
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:52,833
Run-of-the-mill kindness.

997
01:02:52,916 --> 01:02:56,000
It's nothing to do with you.

998
01:02:57,625 --> 01:03:00,416
- Awkward.
- Oh, isn't this just wonderful?

999
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,208
You know what time
it is, fellas?

1000
01:03:02,291 --> 01:03:04,791
- Please, no.
- What time is it?

1001
01:03:04,875 --> 01:03:06,750
It's time to dance.

1002
01:03:06,833 --> 01:03:08,166
Yeah!

1003
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:10,333
Ah, achoo!

1004
01:03:13,500 --> 01:03:15,041
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

1005
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:16,666
Hey, hey!

1006
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:18,208
Hey, hey, hey!

1007
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:31,666
Hey!

1008
01:03:36,791 --> 01:03:38,125
You want to play cards?

1009
01:03:38,208 --> 01:03:39,208
No, thank you.

1010
01:03:39,291 --> 01:03:40,651
What about you?
Do you wanna play?

1011
01:03:41,416 --> 01:03:43,583
You and Maple are fine dancers.

1012
01:03:43,666 --> 01:03:44,791
Ah.

1013
01:03:44,875 --> 01:03:46,375
We're just friends.

1014
01:03:46,458 --> 01:03:47,541
Right.

1015
01:03:47,625 --> 01:03:48,905
You know, like you and Jonathan.

1016
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:53,750
I'm pretty sure Jonathan
only cares about himself.

1017
01:03:55,583 --> 01:03:57,023
Is that why he took
an arrow for ya?

1018
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:58,708
What?

1019
01:03:58,791 --> 01:04:00,125
We all saw it.

1020
01:04:00,791 --> 01:04:02,541
That selfish, no-good thief?

1021
01:04:04,458 --> 01:04:06,083

Soldiers.

1077
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:10,017
- Oh, no.
- We have to leave.

1078
01:08:10,041 --> 01:08:11,559
- To protect the princess.
- Yes, Captain.

1079
01:08:11,583 --> 01:08:13,125
Achoo!

1080
01:08:13,208 --> 01:08:14,642
I can't let the queen's
guard find this place.

1081
01:08:14,666 --> 01:08:15,958
- I'm coming with you.
- No.

1082
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:18,250
It's too dangerous. You're
the one they're looking for.

1083
01:08:19,083 --> 01:08:20,375
I'll be back in two days.

1084
01:08:20,958 --> 01:08:23,750
And together we'll go to
the Southern Kingdom and...

1085
01:08:24,625 --> 01:08:25,875
we'll find your father.

1086
01:08:28,250 --> 01:08:29,250
Well, here.

1087
01:08:30,333 --> 01:08:31,333
He gave this to me.

1088
01:08:32,625 --> 01:08:33,833
Take it for luck.

1089
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:36,791
I can't accept this.

1090
01:08:36,875 --> 01:08:38,875
I'm not giving it to you.

1091
01:08:38,958 --> 01:08:41,000
I'm just giving you
reason to return.

1092
01:08:44,166 --> 01:08:46,041
Who fights in the
name of the king?

1093
01:08:46,125 --> 01:08:47,208
I!

1094
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:48,541
Well, come on, then.

1095
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:50,083
- Be safe.
- All right. Split up.

1096
01:08:50,166 --> 01:08:51,809
We'll lure the guards
away from the cottage.

1097
01:08:51,833 --> 01:08:52,666
Be careful out there!

1098
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:54,083
Hey, thanks for having us.

1099
01:09:07,333 --> 01:09:08,500
Over here.

1100
01:09:10,083 --> 01:09:11,083
This way.

1101
01:09:13,208 --> 01:09:15,041
You're really doing
it, Johnny boy.

1102
01:09:15,666 --> 01:09:17,166
You're one of the good guys.

1103
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:20,250
Honest, steadfast, loyal.

1104
01:09:20,333 --> 01:09:21,916
You're a...

1105
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
idiot.

1106
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,291
You look familiar.

1107
01:09:36,791 --> 01:09:38,458
Oh, yeah.

1108
01:09:38,541 --> 01:09:40,375
The lady with the good potatoes.

1109
01:09:42,458 --> 01:09:43,750
Where is Snow White?

1110
01:09:44,375 --> 01:09:45,375
Snow who?

1111
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,250
You're protecting her.

1112
01:09:47,333 --> 01:09:49,125
Answer Her Majesty.

1113
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:09,500
Show me where you found him.

1114
01:10:09,583 --> 01:10:10,583
In the forest,

1115
01:10:10,625 --> 01:10:13,000
two furlongs south
of the crossroads.

1116
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:15,163
I'm sure you think you got
this licked, Your Majesty.

1117
01:10:15,208 --> 01:10:16,625
But trust me,

1118
01:10:16,708 --> 01:10:19,083
you don't know what
you're up against.

1119
01:10:19,166 --> 01:10:20,541
See, unlike you...

1120
01:10:22,041 --> 01:10:23,125
I know her.

1121
01:10:23,208 --> 01:10:26,333
I think you mean "knew."

1122
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:32,083
I think it's time
for Snow White and I

1123
01:10:32,958 --> 01:10:34,833

It's too dangerous with the queen's
guard out there looking for you.

1149
01:13:02,916 --> 01:13:03,958
We could come with you.

1150
01:13:04,041 --> 01:13:05,375
Do you really have to go?

1151
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:07,916
I need to find the
truth about my father.

1152
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,750
If there's any
chance he's alive...

1153
01:13:09,833 --> 01:13:11,958
And when you find
what you're looking for,

1154
01:13:12,041 --> 01:13:13,458
you'll come back...

1155
01:13:14,833 --> 01:13:15,833
right?

1156
01:13:18,083 --> 01:13:19,458
I will.

1157
01:13:19,541 --> 01:13:20,958
I promise.

1158
01:13:27,833 --> 01:13:28,833
Okay.

1159
01:13:29,333 --> 01:13:31,541
Come on, fellas. Let's go.

1160
01:14:14,791 --> 01:14:15,791
Jonathan?

1161
01:14:20,375 --> 01:14:22,333
I'm sorry, my dear.

1162
01:14:23,416 --> 01:14:24,916
Did I frighten you?

1163
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,041
No, I was expecting
someone else.

1164
01:14:30,083 --> 01:14:31,500
Can I help you?

1165
01:14:31,583 --> 01:14:33,333
It is I who can help you.

1166
01:14:33,916 --> 01:14:35,791
Are you Snow White?

1167
01:14:35,875 --> 01:14:36,958
The princess?

1168
01:14:38,541 --> 01:14:39,916
Who did you say you were?

1169
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:42,000
I have come with a message.

1170
01:14:42,916 --> 01:14:44,041
From Jonathan.

1171
01:14:44,791 --> 01:14:46,000
From Jonathan?

1172
01:14:46,708 --> 01:14:49,333
I'm afraid he's been
captured by the queen.

1173
01:14:50,250 --> 01:14:52,083
Captured? No.

1174
01:14:53,541 --> 01:14:56,166
He gave me this necklace.

1175
01:15:05,583 --> 01:15:07,750
He said you'd know
what it means.

1176
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:14,375
I need to go to him.

1177
01:15:16,875 --> 01:15:18,541
But what of the danger?

1178
01:15:21,333 --> 01:15:24,083
Ah. You love him?

1179
01:15:24,166 --> 01:15:25,166
Well,

1180
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:28,166
because love is so precious,

1181
01:15:29,541 --> 01:15:31,125
I will help you.

1182
01:15:33,958 --> 01:15:34,958
Here.

1183
01:15:35,958 --> 01:15:37,041
Take this apple

1184
01:15:37,125 --> 01:15:39,541
to sustain you on the road.

1185
01:15:45,125 --> 01:15:46,125
Hey!

1186
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:47,625
Whoa!

1187
01:15:57,041 --> 01:15:58,500
Snow White.

1188
01:15:58,583 --> 01:16:03,166
I remember how generous your
father was to his people.

1189
01:16:04,125 --> 01:16:08,666
That's why it is an honor for me to
return the favor to his daughter.

1190
01:16:08,750 --> 01:16:11,125
I know I don't have
much to give...

1191
01:16:12,625 --> 01:16:15,958
but giving you this apple
makes me feel as though

1192
01:16:16,041 --> 01:16:18,000
his spirit is here.

1193
01:16:20,958 --> 01:16:22,250
Come on! Hyah!

1194
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Thank you.

1195
01:16:31,291 --> 01:16:32,500
For him.

1196
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,666
For your father.

1197
01:16:37,625 --> 01:16:39,041
Hyah! Hyah!

1198
01:16:39,125 --> 01:16:41,125
- Go. Come on!
- Faster!

1199
01:17:00,416 --> 01:17:02,000
What's happening?

1200
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,291
Something's wrong.

1201
01:17:04,375 --> 01:17:06,583
I did know your father.

1202
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:10,875
Quite well.

1203
01:17:12,833 --> 01:17:13,833
What do you mean?

1204
01:17:14,416 --> 01:17:16,625
I knew he was a fool!

1205
01:17:16,708 --> 01:17:19,375
You. It's you.

1206
01:17:19,458 --> 01:17:23,541
It was almost too easy
for me to have him killed.

1207
01:17:23,625 --> 01:17:26,333
His goodness cost
him his throne,

1208
01:17:26,416 --> 01:17:29,416
as it will cost you your life.

1209
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:31,583
So...

1210
01:17:32,333 --> 01:17:34,916
tell me, Snow White...

1211
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,750
...who is the
fairest one of all?

1212
01:18:30,291 --> 01:18:34,250
Your envious
heart can be at rest.

1213
01:18:34,333 --> 01:18:37,333
You, my Queen,

1214
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,625
are fairest of all.

1215
01:18:51,416 --> 01:18:53,750
All hail the queen,

1216
01:18:54,416 --> 01:18:56,375
fairest of them all.

1217
01:20:40,041 --> 01:20:41,708
You've
done this every day.

1218
01:20:42,583 --> 01:20:43,583
It hasn't moved.

1219
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:53,333
Forget it.

1220
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:57,625
I did forget.

1221
01:20:59,958 --> 01:21:01,791
I forgot what it
was to have courage,

1222
01:21:02,583 --> 01:21:04,041
to have hope, but then...

1223
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,041
then I met Snow White.

1224
01:21:08,833 --> 01:21:10,125
She fought for us.

1225
01:21:11,041 --> 01:21:12,041
With us.

1226
01:21:13,666 --> 01:21:15,666
When she had every
reason to run.

1227
01:21:16,791 --> 01:21:18,416
She never gave up on us.

1228
01:21:20,875 --> 01:21:22,041
I am not...

1229
01:21:23,083 --> 01:21:24,541
giving up on her.

1230
01:21:46,416 --> 01:21:48,125
- Come on.
- Pull harder.

1231
01:21:58,666 --> 01:22:01,458
Listen, the queen's secret
entrance lets out one mile

1232
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:03,958
from the royal stables where
there's dozens of horses.

1233
01:22:06,250 --> 01:22:08,000
I'll check for guards. You go.

1234
01:22:08,625 --> 01:22:09,708
Good luck.

1235
01:22:15,208 --> 01:22:16,208
Whoa.

1236
01:23:01,083 --> 01:23:02,166
I'm so sorry.

1237
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:08,791
Snow White...

1238
01:24:08,875 --> 01:24:11,416
- Ah.
- She's alive!

1239
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,375
- She's awake.
- It's a miracle.

1240
01:24:24,375 --> 01:24:25,375
Jonathan.

1241
01:24:38,041 --> 01:24:39,041
What is it?

1242
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:41,291
Hey, what's wrong?

1243
01:24:43,375 --> 01:24:44,625
My father...

1244
01:24:46,458 --> 01:24:48,166
He's gone forever.

1245
01:24:51,541 --> 01:24:53,125
Murdered by the queen.

1246
01:24:59,291 --> 01:25:01,166
Oh, dear.

1247
01:25:02,833 --> 01:25:04,375

Time to restore our kingdom.

1265
01:26:32,625 --> 01:26:34,166
It won't be easy.

1266
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:36,458
She'll do everything
she can to stop us.

1267
01:26:42,666 --> 01:26:43,916
Let her try.

1268

Dopey?

We're not afraid.

01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:52,750
Dopey.

1272
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:54,041
Not anymore.

1273
01:26:54,833 --> 01:26:55,833
Oh, wow.

1274
01:26:57,875 --> 01:26:59,541
Well said, Dopey.

1275
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:01,500
Then neither am I.

1276
01:27:08,458 --> 01:27:09,500
Follow me.

1277
01:27:44,916 --> 01:27:47,000

1278
01:28:01,416 --> 01:28:03,456

I believe it is you
who's looking for me.

1289
01:30:29,083 --> 01:30:30,083
Stand aside.

1290
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:43,333
This is my father's house.

1291
01:30:46,750 --> 01:30:47,958
You killed him.

1292
01:30:50,333 --> 01:30:52,833
You stole it from
him, from all of us.

1293
01:30:57,041 --> 01:30:58,916
And now we're here
to take it back.

1294
01:31:04,916 --> 01:31:05,916
Pretty...

1295
01:31:06,750 --> 01:31:07,750
isn't she?

1296
01:31:12,041 --> 01:31:15,208
Delicate, elegant, exquisite.

1297
01:31:23,125 --> 01:31:24,958
You think you want a flower.

1298
01:31:26,416 --> 01:31:28,291
But a flower wilts.

1299
01:31:29,833 --> 01:31:32,291
A flower cannot keep you safe.

1300
01:31:33,083 --> 01:31:34,875
Or raise an army,

1301
01:31:34,958 --> 01:31:36,625
or lead a kingdom.

1302
01:31:37,208 --> 01:31:40,083
A flower cannot give
you what I can give you.

1303
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:47,000
Perfection.

1304
01:31:48,958 --> 01:31:50,125
Power.

1305
01:31:52,041 --> 01:31:53,041
Beauty.

1306
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:07,250
If you want the throne...

1307
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:14,541
take it.

1308
01:32:33,041 --> 01:32:34,208
They're waiting.

1309
01:32:45,916 --> 01:32:47,333
Enough of this charade.

1310
01:32:47,416 --> 01:32:49,083
Guards, hold her.

1311
01:32:49,750 --> 01:32:50,750
You.

1312
01:32:54,291 --> 01:32:56,333
Let the people watch her die.

1313
01:33:27,333 --> 01:33:28,333
Paul.

1314
01:33:34,833 --> 01:33:36,458
You were a farmer.

1315
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,375
In the Western Vale.

1316
01:33:41,750 --> 01:33:43,083
You have a wife.

1317
01:33:44,458 --> 01:33:45,583
Eleanor.

1318
01:33:51,958 --> 01:33:54,833
You had a grove of cherry trees
and when they would blossom,

1319
01:33:54,916 --> 01:33:57,291
you would invite the village
to come and pick them.

1320
01:33:59,333 --> 01:34:00,583
To share them.

1321
01:34:03,541 --> 01:34:04,625
Matthew.

1322
01:34:05,541 --> 01:34:06,791
You were a baker...

1323
01:34:08,208 --> 01:34:09,625
just like your father.

1324
01:34:10,916 --> 01:34:13,541
You never turned anyone
away if they were hungry,

1325
01:34:13,625 --> 01:34:16,166
even if they didn't have a
coin left in their pocket.

1326
01:34:17,916 --> 01:34:18,833
Arthur.

1327
01:34:18,916 --> 01:34:19,916
Enough.

1328
01:34:19,958 --> 01:34:20,958
William.

1329
01:34:23,250 --> 01:34:24,708
I remember you.

1330
01:34:24,791 --> 01:34:26,041
All of you.

1331
01:34:26,125 --> 01:34:27,375
I said, "Enough!"

1332
01:34:27,458 --> 01:34:29,625
There was a time where
we lived with hope.

1333
01:34:30,708 --> 01:34:33,291
When good things were
nurtured and allowed to grow.

1334
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:37,916
I remember.

1335
01:34:41,500 --> 01:34:42,666
Do you?

1336
01:34:51,166 --> 01:34:52,333
I remember.

1337
01:34:58,583 --> 01:34:59,583
I remember.

1338
01:35:01,916 --> 01:35:03,166
And I.

1339
01:35:05,916 --> 01:35:06,916
And I.

1340
01:35:09,875 --> 01:35:11,083
And I.

1341
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:17,500
Leave.

1342
01:35:18,666 --> 01:35:20,041
Now.

1343
01:35:20,125 --> 01:35:21,416
And never come back.

1344
01:35:31,208 --> 01:35:33,041
I am the rebel Quigg,

1345
01:35:33,666 --> 01:35:35,083
master of the crossbow.

1346
01:35:50,791 --> 01:35:53,375
No.

1347
01:35:56,583 --> 01:35:57,833
It isn't true.

1348
01:35:58,375 --> 01:36:01,625
Look at me. I'm
still the fairest.

1349
01:36:01,708 --> 01:36:04,041
Famed is thy beauty.

1350
01:36:04,125 --> 01:36:06,583
But it goes no
further than the skin.

1351
01:36:07,375 --> 01:36:09,250
For Snow White,

1352
01:36:09,333 --> 01:36:12,208
beauty comes from deep within.

1353
01:36:12,916 --> 01:36:14,375
And so, my Queen,

1354
01:36:14,458 --> 01:36:16,416
at last, you see.

1355
01:36:16,916 --> 01:36:19,458
She will always be

1356
01:36:19,541 --> 01:36:22,458
more fair than thee.

1357
01:36:22,541 --> 01:36:24,250
You lie!

1358
01:36:34,958 --> 01:36:39,208
Snow White
more fair than thee.

1359
01:37:51,875 --> 01:37:53,916
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

1360
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,166

1361
01:37:56,250 --> 01:37:58,791
<i>governed by a virtuous queen</i>

1362
01:37:58,875 --> 01:38:01,666
who believed that the
true beauty of her land

1363
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:04,750
was not to be measured
in gems or jewels,

1364
01:38:05,375 --> 01:38:07,583
but in its people.

1365
01:38:07,666 --> 01:38:10,708
The queen ruled with
kindness and love.

1366
01:38:11,750 --> 01:38:16,125
She was fearless,
fair, brave and true.

1367
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:21,250
