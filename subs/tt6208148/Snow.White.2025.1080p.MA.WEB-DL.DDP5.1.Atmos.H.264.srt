1
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,735
Once upon a time,
there was a peaceful kingdom

2
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:12,197
ruled by a virtuous
queen and king.

3
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,158
More than anything,
they wished for a child.

4
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,663
One winter's night,
a blizzard swept through their
land,

5
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:24,876
blotting out the kingdom
in a bitter storm of snow and
ice,

6
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,505
but leaving them a
most precious gift.

7
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,049
A princess was born.

8
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,551
To honor the night she arrived,

9
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:37,097
her parents named
the girl Snow White.

10
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,769
As she grew,
the king and queen taught Snow
White

11
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:46,856
that the bounty of the land
belonged to all who tended it.

12
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:50,485
They showed her how
to rule with love.

13
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:54,656
For someday, her destiny
would be to lead.

Hi.

60
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,050
The king and queen
watched with pride

61
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:05,221
as Snow White grew
into a kind and fair young
princess.

62
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,436
But then, tragedy struck.

63
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,606
Snow White's mother fell ill.

64
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,443
And the Good Queen died.

65
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:25,241
Snow White and the
king were heartbroken.

66
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:27,785
Until...

67
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,583
an enchanting woman from a far
-off land appeared at the
palace.

68
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:50,516
So great was her
beauty that it seemed

69
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,852
to grant her powers
beyond the ordinary.

70
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,357
She married the king,

71
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:00,109
but she was not
what she appeared.

72
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,571
She was evil

73
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,949
and cared only
about her own beauty

74
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,328
and the power it granted.

75
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,623
To protect that power,

76
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,875
she kept a magic mirror

77
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:19,337
which could answer
but one simple question.

78
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,131
Magic Mirror on the wall,

79
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:26,594
who is the fairest of them all?

80
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,931
You, my Queen,

81
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:33,476
of all the women reckoned fair,

82
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:38,106
your beauty is beyond compare.

83
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:41,484
The new queen wasted
no time seizing power.

84
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:46,114
She warned of a terrible threat
from beyond the Southern
Kingdom.

85
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,908
So the Good King swore
to defend his people.

86
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,662
♪ Hold it close ♪

87
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:56,374
♪ Til I return to you ♪

88
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,386
But the
king did not return.

89
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,392
Fear gripped the kingdom.

90
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:17,019
And the queen's power grew.

91
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,357
She turned the
farmers into soldiers

92
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,025
loyal only to her,

93
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:26,904
and robbed the riches of the
kingdom for herself.

94
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,616
She made Snow White a servant

95
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:34,203
and locked her away
behind the castle walls.

96
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:40,209
But as long as the mirror
answered the queen each day tht
she was the fairest,

97
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,963
Snow White remained safe
from the queen's cruel jealous.

As the years passed,

106
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,867
the people nearly forgot

107
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,786
there ever was a princess
named Snow White.

109
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,508
And in truth,

110
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,386
Snow White nearly
forgot herself.

111
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,398
Hello?

112
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,033
I'm sorry.

113
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,077
Is there something
I can help you with?

114
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,456
That's okay. Just browsing.

115
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,501
Well, I'm going to have to ask
you to put those back.

116
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,128
I would, but it seems like
the queen has plenty already.

117
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,423
Oh, I see.
So that's your excuse for
stealing?

118
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,176
My friends are hungry. I'm
hungry. That's my excuse.

119
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:16,305
Maybe I can speak
with the queen.

120
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,102
You really think the people
upstairs want to share with
people like us?

121
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,144
Well, the princess would.

122
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,646
Snow White.

123
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,441
Snow White hasn't been seen or
heard from in many years.

124
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,110
I doubt she'll be of
any help to anyone.

125
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,153
All she does is think of
how to help her people.

126
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,281
Well, then you should let her
know, at some point,

127
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:35,074
it might be useful for her
to stop thinking.

128
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,576
Maybe start doing.

129
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,622
There's an intruder in
the castle. Seal the doors!

130
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,124
Take some for yourself.

131
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,002
And share the rest
with your princess.

132
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,092
Maybe no one else
has even told her.

133
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,762
I'm sure if the queen was aware
of how desperate things have
gotten,

134
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,472
she would be happy to share.

135
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:03,811
I at least have to try,

136
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:06,314
even if it is just a wish.

137
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:09,859
Wish... Wish...

138
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,694
Wish...

139
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,825
Snow White, have you
finished your chores?

140
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,286
Yes, Your Majesty.

141
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,913
It's important we
all do our share.

142
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,583
Well, that's what I came
to speak to you about, actually.

143
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,251
Sharing.

144
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,971
Please.

145
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,223
You were saying?

146
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,643
It's just...

147
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,728
Your Majesty,

148
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,814
people are struggling,
and it may not be much,

149
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:53,486
but when I was young,
my parents and I would pick
apples.

150
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:54,862
We'd take them and make pies,

151
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,781
-then go out into the village...
-Pies?

152
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,784
Pies are luxuries.
They don't need luxuries.

153
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,994
It confuses them.

154
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:05,706
But sometimes something small,
something sweet even,

155
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:09,460
can make you believe that
there's more to being alive than
mere subsistence.

156
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,547
You know, I really don't
remember you being this...

157
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,466
opinionated.

158
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,052
My apologies. It's just...

159
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:21,347
I feel they need some kindness.

160
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:32,566
"Fearless, fair, brave, true."

161
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,361
How quaint.

162
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:40,449
One day, you'll understand
how useless those words are.

163
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,202
But in the meantime,

164
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,414
here's a tidbit for you.

165
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,290
Observe.

166
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:52,878
Ravishing, isn't it?

167
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,963
Yes, Your Majesty.

168
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:58,134
One is weak, useless, fragile.

169
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:03,389
The other hard, unyielding,

170
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,766
everlasting, flawless,

171
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,601
beautiful.

172
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,939
My subjects don't want a flower.

173
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:14,191
They want a diamond.

174
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,362
-Your Highness...
-Get your hands off me!

175
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:22,450
...this criminal was caught
in the scullery pilfering royal
supplies.

176
00:12:22,491 --> 00:12:23,784
That's a lie.

177
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,003
Are you one of the bandits

178
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,756
that gather in the forest
stealing in the name of the
king?

179
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,215
No, no, Your Majesty.

180
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,051
Not "one of the
bandits." I'm the boss.

181
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,804
Loyal to the one true king.

182
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,891
Find his home and
burn it to the ground.

183
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,601
Funny thing is,

184
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:49,685
I don't actually have a home.

185
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,479
Then take him to the dungeon.

186
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,231
-Fill the castle with his cries.
-Your Majesty...

187
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,277
I understand the
need for justice.

188
00:12:58,319 --> 00:12:59,737
But please, this isn't fair.

189
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,368
What did you say?

190
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:11,957
The punishment must
not exceed the crime,

191
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,502
- and I know my father would...
- Your father?

192
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,670
Your father?

193
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,507
My father would show mercy.

194
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,932
I'm sorry, my
dear. You're right.

195
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,519
This thief stole from me.

196
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,021
So, I will steal from him.

197
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:37,316
Remove his coat and boots
and bind him to the gates to
freeze.

198
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,818
You know, is the
dungeon still an option?

199
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,361
Take him away!

200
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,696
Wait, he'll perish.
Please, Your Majesty.

201
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:43,739
Snow White!

202
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,741
Here...

203
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,118
look at yourself.

00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,621
Isn't this what you want?

205
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:52,957
Go on,

206
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,000
speak to your people.

207
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,879
Your subjects await
you, Snow White.

208
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:03,133
Your pies and your wise words.

209
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,594
What will you tell them, hmm?

210
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,764
That you've made them dessert?

211
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,101
You live in a world of wishes.

212
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,729

Huntsman?

00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,572
Your Majesty.

307
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:42,908
Take Snow White far
into the forest.

308
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,954
Find a secluded glade
where she can pick apples,

309
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,413
and there,

310
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,959
my faithful Huntsman,

311
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:53,919
kill her.

312
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:55,837

313
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:57,798
Majesty,

314
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,508
she's just a girl.

315
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,469
And I'm your queen.

316
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,973
It was Snow White who
set the bandit free.

317
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,891
She's plotting against me.

318
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,769
Now, tell me,

319
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,397
are you against me, too?

320
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,734
Are you? Yes or no?

321
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,403
No,

322
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:20,904
Majesty.

323
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,371
Take
her to the forest.

324
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,164
Kill her.

325
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,667
Cut out her heart.

326
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,420
Put it in this box.

00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:50,619
Why?

334
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,464
You must flee into the woods.

335
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,007
The queen is mad.
She'll stop at nothing.

336
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,425
I can't leave the kingdom.

337
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,135
She is evil, child.

338
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:08,845
She's a liar.

339
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,057
You were never told the truth
about your father.

340
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:13,934

Home sweet home.

437
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,470
It is indeed exceptional
to be back at our place of
habitation.

438
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,180
Is it me or
is it dusty in here?

439
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,932
It's you.

440
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,062
Can't wait to floss.

441
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,031
It's a... It's a...

442
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,282
It's a...

443
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,325
What?

444
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,618
He did it again.

445
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:34,786
Narcoleptic cataplexy.

446
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,788
I thought he just...

447
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,206
fell asleep when he was worried.

448
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:40,249
What's there to
be worried about?

449
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,713
Time to worry!

450
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,382
Barricade the door!

451
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,429
Guys, where's Dopey?

452
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,268
Don't move.

453
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,561
Ogres smell fear.

454
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:02,397
It's not an ogre. It's a
phantasm.

455
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,564
Should he
crouch and hide?

456
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,024
Or make himself big and roar?

457
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,442
Depends what kind of ogre.

458
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,652
It's not an ogre!

459
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,861
It's a demon goat.

460
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,196
Don't look
it in the eyes.

461
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,823
If you see ectoplasm,

462
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,992
- don't touch it.
- Is it floating?

463
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,535
Be careful, Dopey.

464
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,823
Don't be afraid.

465
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,119
It's all right.

466
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,291
I only wanted to meet you.

467
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,671
What's your name?

468
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,593
Don't you speak?

469
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,428
Let's take
back our friend!

470
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,098
Wait, wait. Please.

471
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,850
-Why...
-It's a human.

472
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,269
Well, yes. What did
you think I was?

473
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,353
-Nothing.
-Ghost.

474
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,773
- But where did you come from?
- Are you hungry?

475
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:27,940
Can we be friends?

476
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,150
What's your name?

477
00:34:29,192 --> 00:34:30,902
Why is everyone
being so cordial?

478
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:33,905
The only human things that come
into the forest anymore are
bandits

479
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:36,866
-who claim to fight in the
king's name. -What?

480
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,327
You're in trouble with
the law, aren't ya?

481
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,829
Hmm?

482
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,498
-I'd better go.
-Told ya.

483
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,750
- No, no, no. Wait, wait. Hold
on. - Let her leave.

484
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,002
Well, at least tell
us who you are.

485
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,212
- Yeah.
- Yes.

486
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,922
My name is Snow White.

487
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,469
- Snow White?
- The princess?

488
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,637
I say it's a trap.

489
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:59,764
But she needs our help.

490
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,974
- Anyone still think
she's a ghost? -Wait, wait,
wait. Where are you going?

491
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:04,102
As far away from the
castle as possible.

492
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,561
- That's not good
enough. - But why?

493
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,484
The truth is, the
queen tried to kill me.

494
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,986
She really tried to kill you?

495
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,321
Well, that's terrible.

496
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:18,241
It's also exactly why
you have to leave.

497
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,618
You should stay here until you
figure out where you're gonna
go.

498
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,037
-What?
-I think that's a wonderful
idea.

499
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,372
Now, hold on.

500
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:26,582
A human shows up in this cottage
for the first time

501
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,000
in 275 years

502
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,460
and you ask her to stay?

503
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,045
Did he just say

504
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,839
275 years?

505
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,550
274, to be precise.

506
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,260
We're as old as the trees.

507
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,471
My parents always said
this forest was a magical place.

508
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:43,516
And I've always said
that humans cause nothing but
trouble.

509
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,143
I'm sorry. I don't
know your name.

510
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,771
Allow me to introduce
in alphabetical order.

511
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:50,481
Bashful. Dopey.

512
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,024
Grumpy. Happy.

513
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,484
Sleepy. Sneezy.

514
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,069
And I'm Doc.

515
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,905
You said we were doing
reverse alphabetical order this
time.

516
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,365
That was last time.

517
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,908
So, in reverse order,

518
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,911
it's Sneezy, Sleepy, Happy,
Grumpy, Dopey, Doc, and Bashful.

519
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,705
Well, I'll be.

520
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:07,415
How did she do that?

521
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:10,001
My mother always taught me
that it was important to learn a
name.

522
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:12,503
Well, in order of the longest
toes to the shortest toes,

523
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,921
I have the longest toes.

524
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:16,757
If that helps.

525
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:20,386
And what exactly do you do
out here in the forest?

526
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,472
Oh. Well, it's our
job to mine the mines.

527
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,141
You'd be amazed at
what you can find.

528
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,059
Sparkling rocks of every kind.

529
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:28,603
A place where
magic still abides.

530
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:30,688
Not for long if she resides!

531
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,148
Look at the time.

532
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:38,487
The important thing is that Snow
White is out of harm's way at
our address.

533
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,822
- Right, fellas?
- Yeah.

534
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,616
-Absolutely.
-Objection.

535
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,492
Noted. Just ignore him.

536
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,125
Maybe I'll just
stay for one night.

537
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,002
One night. Then she leaves.

538
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,379
-You can come here.
-What size are your slippers?

539
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,840
-I love slumber parties.
-We got some spare upstairs.

540
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,800
You'll be safe
from the queen here.

541
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,102
Magic Mirror on the wall,

542
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:14,398
who's the fairest one of all?

543
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,443
Far beyond the castle wall,

544
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,238
somewhere in the woods dwells

545
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,740
Snow White,

546
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,951
fairest one of all.

547
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:25,952
No.

548
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:28,871
I am only bound by what is true.

549
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:31,374
The fairest lives.

550
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,918

It's the morning,
and she's still here.

618
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,802
They'll come looking for her,

619
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,096
and when they find her...

620
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,850
What do you have
to say about that?

621
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:20,561
- Now, Grumpy, you know Dopey
doesn't talk. -

622
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:21,687
Because he's a dope!

623
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,731
Just because his name is Dopey

624
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:26,233
doesn't mean he's
actually a dope.

625
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:28,402
Of course that's the reason.

626
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,530
Same as how you're called Happy
because you're happy.

627
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,533
And I'm called Grumpy
because I'm... I'm...

628
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,619
misunderstood.

629
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,331
Ow!

630
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:41,749
Shish kebabs!

631
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:44,668
Huh?

632
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,171
Here you go.

633
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,589
Hey!

634
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:51,300
Guys, let's all just
try to be friends.

635
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,679
Ow. Stop.

636
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,557
Hey! Yippee ki-yay!

637
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,311
-You're toast, mister!
-Aha!

638
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:05,314
Come here!

639
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,649
Settle down.

640
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,109
I'm gonna
get your long toe!

641
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:10,569
Grumpy, that tickles!

642
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,322
Oh...

643
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,949
- Oh, my foot!
- Huh?

644
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:19,787
Oh, no!

645
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:22,039
Pepper!

646
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,500
He's gonna blow.

647
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:25,543
Achoo!

648
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:37,763
Dopey,

649
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,515
breakfast is supposed
to go in your mouth.

650
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,101
Not on your head!

651
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,812
Isn't life gruel?

652
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:46,355
You get it? Gruel!

653
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,161
Are you all right?

654
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:06,584
Makes you want to run and hide.

655
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,340
Are you afraid to speak?

656
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:17,720
Oh.

657
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,850
Well, then, maybe we can start
with something small.

658
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:25,644
When I was a little girl,
my mother taught me how to
whistle.

659
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:29,273
So, even when I'm afraid to
speak, I whistle.

660
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,567
Because when you whistle,
it's your heart singing.

661
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,610
And that voice,

662
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:35,738
the one that's
hidden in your heart,

663
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,031
can be heard.

664
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,163
See? Now you try.

665
00:43:52,254 --> 00:43:55,966
Well, just enough
to make a candle flicker.

666
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,009
Not go out.

667
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,071
You did it.

668
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,366
I knew you could.

669
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:22,993
Come on.

670
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:27,164
Hey! Come here.

671
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:29,708
Give it back!

672
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,836
I got it.

673
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:40,427
What's that divine
and ravishing noise?

674
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:43,305
Did a songbird come through a
window?

675
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,723
It's Dopey.

676
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,517
He sounds
like a baby angel.

677
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:47,768
It's a trick.

678
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:48,727
It's not a trick.

679
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:51,105
How are you doing that?

680
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,856
Well, you put your lips
together,

681
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:55,567
place your tongue behind your
teeth and whistle.

682
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:58,696
That's easy.

683
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:07,579
Is this normal,
or just something you do among
friends?

684
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:08,872
We're not friends.

685
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:11,417
275 years is a
long time to argue.

686
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:13,085
274.

687
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,128
Leave me out of it.

688
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:16,588
-I'm the only sensible one here.
-Oh.

689
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,882
And you feel like
they're not listening to sense?

690
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:20,050
Correct.

691
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,844
I take your point, Mr. Grumpy.

692
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:24,012
You... Wait.

693
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:27,015
What?

694
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:29,143
Well, it seems to me
that everyone here

695
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:31,562
could do a much better job
at listening to one another.

696
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:43,949
I was thinking the same thing.

697
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,451
Hey.

698
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:47,161
Uh, Miss White,
I wouldn't look in there if I...

699
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:49,163
She's really making herself at
home.

700
00:45:49,204 --> 00:45:50,664
I don't remember those.

701
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:53,208
Now you wash the dishes.

702
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,794
You tidy up the room.

703
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,463
-Okay.
-Come on.

704
00:45:57,504 --> 00:46:00,257
You clean those cobwebs.

705
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,676
And he'll use

706
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:04,052
the broom.

707
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,345

00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:02,522
Well, when I was a little girl,
every day was like this.

756
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:03,815
Every day?

757
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,150
Every day.

758
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,404
When my father was king.

759
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,239
Oh.

760
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:15,077
The Huntsman said
the queen lied about my father.

761
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,703
She lied about everything.

762
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,247
What if he's still alive?

763
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,334
I have to find him.

764
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,921
You said that there were bandits
in the forest

765
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,422
who claimed to fight
in the king's name.

766
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:28,507
Human criminals.

767
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:30,425
Those rebels are
nothing but thieves.

768
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,386
They're actually
a band of erstwhile actors

769
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:34,388
whose sustenance
was made unstable

770
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:36,556
by the queen's greedy
economic policies

771
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:38,266
which forced them
into a liminal space

772
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,227
where ethics and
motives are ill-defined.

773
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:42,354
Well, where are they?

774
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:45,607
If they know the truth about my
father, I need to find them.

775
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,150
Oh, no. I advise against it.

776
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,527
It's too dangerous.

777
00:49:48,568 --> 00:49:49,611
Stay with me.

778
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,948
I mean, us.

779
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,201
Yeah. You barely got away
from the queen the last time.

780
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,244
Gesundheit.

781
00:49:57,744 --> 00:50:00,038
But this is what I have to do.

782
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,290
Besides, Grumpy's right.

783
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:05,377
The longer I stay here with you,
the more danger I put you in.

784
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,004
At last.

785
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,548
-Goodbye.
-Grumpy!

786
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:10,590
No.

787
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:12,926
It's time for me to stop hiding.

788
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:15,262
Thank you all
for showing me such kindness.

789
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:16,304
No, wait a minute.

790
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:17,597
Even you, Grumpy.

791
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,683
Now,

792
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,226
can you point me in
the right direction?

793
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:24,479
We're late for work!

794
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:25,647
Come on, everybody.
I need you to...

795
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:27,274
I'll get the snacks.

796
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:29,151
Come on, Sleepy. Hello?

797
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:43,141
Don't say a word.

798
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:44,768
You.

799
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:48,021
If we go this way,
we'll link up with the other
riders.

800
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:54,945
And when I told you
to come see what it was like out
here,

801
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:57,280
didn't expect you to bring
half the palace guards with you.

802
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:59,157
I didn't exactly invite them.

803
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:01,076
I had no choice but to run.

804
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:03,203
The queen wants me dead.

805
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:07,999
Come on.

806
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:11,044
I'm actually looking
for my father.

807
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,130
I was hoping you might
be able to help me.

808
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:15,549
You're loyal to
the one true king.

809
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:18,927
Right.

810
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,221
Absolutely.

811
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:22,264
We, uh...

812
00:52:23,014 --> 00:52:25,016
We hear rumors, whispers.

813
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:29,187
Some people say he was taken
prisoner in the Southern
Kingdom, but...

814
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,064
You have no idea where he is.

815
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:33,233
I'm so sorry to disappoint.

816
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,444
You must have mistaken me
for a knight in shining armor.

817
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,739
I don't think anyone's
making that mistake.

818
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,325
I was hoping you
might know something.

819
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:43,368
Oh, of course.

820
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,705
Princesses are always waiting
for a prince to show up or a
king to come back.

821
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:51,126
My father is the only person who
can restore this kingdom to what
it once was.

822
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,044
A little late for
that, I'm afraid.

823
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:55,589
Obviously, you've forgotten
how things used to be,

824
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:58,425
when people were kind and fair.

825
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,511
I wish I had time
for things like

826
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:03,555
kindness and fairness.

00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,308

00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:53,600
Just "Jonathan..."

890
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,020
Princess.

891
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,189
Look...

00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:02,859

00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:04,986

Whoa!

902
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:33,056
It's the palace guards.

903
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,682
Two soldiers for
every one of us.

904
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:37,310
We are searching
for the Princess Snow White.

905
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:38,520
You have to run, Princess.

906
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:39,729
What about all of you?

907
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,564
Don't worry about us.
We'll hold them off.

908
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:43,650
-I'll fight with you.
-I'm not asking.

909
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:44,818
I'm making it a fair fight.

910
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:47,070
Yeah, the thing is,
I don't fight fair.

911
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:50,740
Don't shoot!

912
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:53,118
We can tell you where
the princess is.

913
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,174
Now.

914
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:24,274
I can't leave.

915
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:26,359
I'm going to need your help.

916
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,971
Last chance, bandits.

917
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,640
Tell us what you
know of Snow White.

918
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,477
You seek Snow White?

919
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:02,896
I'm over here.

920
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,149
This way.

921
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,195
- Go!
- Move!

922
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,364
Spread out!

923
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:36,930
Spread out. Find them.

924
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:37,972
Yes, sir!

925
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:42,393
Where's my horse?

926
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,028
Go, go.

927
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:55,156
You came back.

928
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:57,617
Someone had to solve
your princess problem.

929
00:58:57,659 --> 00:58:58,952
I told you I'd fight with you.

930
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:01,329
- I guess you meant it.
- I guess so.

931
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:04,415
You continue to impress me.

932
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:06,209
Oh, thank you.

933
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:09,921
Compliment like that coming from
a criminal mastermind like
yourself.

934
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:14,842
Make sure we lost them.

935
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,266
The people,

936
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:23,434
they've forgotten
how it used to be.

937
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,437
And they despise the queen.
But they're afraid.

938
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:30,316
That's why we fight
in your father's name.

939
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:34,737
Your parents weren't
afraid of anything.

940
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:38,408
They made us all
feel a little braver.

941
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:43,871
They gave everyone hope.

942
00:59:56,217 --> 00:59:58,303
Now, we'll cut
through to the glen a mile
south.

943
00:59:58,344 --> 01:00:00,179
We need to cover our tracks.

944
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:17,280
- Jonathan?
-  -What was that?

945
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:18,656
Oh, no.

946
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:21,034
I think we have a bit of a
problem, Princess.

947
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:22,827
He's
going to need a doctor.

948
01:00:23,536 --> 01:00:26,706
Doc is more of a sobriquet
rather than a technical title

949
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:28,499
as my true expertise lies

950
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:31,711
in the study of igneous,
sedimentary, and metamorphic
granules.

951
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:34,422
You know, rocks.

952
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:35,757
Oh!

953
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:38,676
I am the rebel Quigg,

954
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:40,470
master of the crossbow,

955
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:42,055
and I'm ordering
you to save him.

956
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:44,849
- Oh, we haven't even been
introduced yet. -

957
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:46,809
-In alphabetical order...
-Doc, please, we don't have
time.

958
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:48,311
He's badly injured.
You have to help.

959
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:49,771
But they're bandits!

960
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:51,731
-What are you gonna do about it?
-Come here, you.

961
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:56,903
This is exactly how the queen
would want us to behave.

962
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:58,529
Fighting with each other,

963
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:02,158
distrusting each other.
This is how she wins!

964
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:06,287
She's poisoned everyone into
believing that it's everyone for
themselves.

965
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:10,708
But if...

966
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:13,836
we can give up
our meager scraps,

967
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:17,548
we will inherit
what was meant for all of us.

968
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:21,719
And it's more than
any of us can imagine.

969
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:23,888
It just...

970
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:27,642
requires faith in each other.

971
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:29,185
Mmm.

972
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,355
Now help him.

973
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:35,650
Please.

974
01:01:37,819 --> 01:01:38,653
Hmm.

975
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:43,366
Bring him inside.

976
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:47,203
Hot milk.

977
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:50,707
It helps me sleep.

978
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:51,749
Thank you.

979
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:02,135
I used the blast furnace
to cut through the bedrock,

980
01:02:02,176 --> 01:02:04,137
then drilled to
the fissure core,

981
01:02:04,178 --> 01:02:06,139
added a poultice or two.

982
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:08,558
A dose of acetum saturninum,

983
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:10,893
acid of sulfur dulcified.

984
01:02:10,935 --> 01:02:13,646
Uh...

985
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:22,196
-Oh, oh!
-That was...

986
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,114
Huh.

987
01:02:25,074 --> 01:02:26,701
- ...unpleasant.
- You did it, Doc.

988
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:27,785
I thought he was dead.

989
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:34,000
Hey.

990
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,757
-Thank you, Doc.
-Of course.

991
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:44,177
I would do anything
for Snow White's special friend.

992
01:02:44,218 --> 01:02:46,387
- Ooh! You got a special
friend. -Oh, no.

993
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,181
- No.
- Oh.

994
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:49,724
- No. No.
- What?

995
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,517
- I would have brought anyone
here to... - Exactly.

996
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:52,894
Run-of-the-mill kindness.

997
01:02:52,935 --> 01:02:55,980
It's nothing to do with you.

998
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:00,443
- Awkward.
- Oh, isn't this just wonderful?

999
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:02,236
You know what time
it is, fellas?

1000
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:04,822
-Please, no.
-What time is it?

1001
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:06,783
It's time to dance.

1002
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:08,201
Yeah!

1003
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:10,369
Ah, achoo!

1004
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:15,082
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

1005
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:16,709
Hey, hey!

1006
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,252
Hey, hey, hey!

1007
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:31,724
Hey!

1008
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:38,147
You want to play cards?

1009
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:39,232
No, thank you.

1010
01:03:39,273 --> 01:03:40,274
What about you?
Do you wanna play?

1011
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,611
You and Maple are fine dancers.

1012
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:44,821
Ah.

1013
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:46,405
We're just friends.

1014
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:47,573
Right.

1015
01:03:47,615 --> 01:03:48,658
You know, like you and Jonathan.

1016
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:53,746
I'm pretty sure
Jonathan only cares about
himself.

1017
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:56,999
Is that why he took
an arrow for ya?

1018
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:58,751
What?

1019
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:00,127
We all saw it.

1020
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:02,547
That selfish, no-good thief?

1021
01:04:04,465 --> 01:04:06,092

-Hi.

1076
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:08,709
Soldiers.

1077
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:10,002
- Oh, no.
- We have to leave.

1078
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:11,545
- To protect the princess.
- Yes, Captain.

1079
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:13,172
Achoo!

1080
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:14,632
I can't let the queen's guard
find this place.

1081
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:16,175
-I'm coming with you.
-No.

1082
01:08:16,217 --> 01:08:18,260
It's too dangerous.
You're the one they're looking
for.

1083
01:08:19,095 --> 01:08:20,387
I'll be back in two days.

1084
01:08:20,971 --> 01:08:23,766
And together
we'll go to the Southern Kingdom
and...

1085
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:25,893
we'll find your father.

1086
01:08:28,270 --> 01:08:29,230
Well, here.

1087
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:31,315
He gave this to me.

1088
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:33,818
Take it for luck.

1089
01:08:35,236 --> 01:08:36,821
I can't accept this.

1090
01:08:36,862 --> 01:08:38,906
I'm not giving it to you.

1091
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,991
I'm just giving you
reason to return.

1092
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:46,080
Who fights in the
name of the king?

1093
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,248
I!

1094
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:48,582
Well, come on, then.

1095
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:50,126
-Be safe.
-All right. Split up.

1096
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:51,794
We'll lure the guards away
from the cottage.

1097
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:52,711
Be careful out there!

1098
01:08:52,753 --> 01:08:54,088
Hey, thanks for having us.

1099
01:09:07,351 --> 01:09:08,519
Over here.

1100
01:09:10,062 --> 01:09:11,063
This way.

1101
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:15,025
You're really doing
it, Johnny boy.

1102
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:17,194
You're one of the good guys.

1103
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:20,281
Honest, steadfast, loyal.

1104
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:21,949
You're a...

1105
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:22,825
idiot.

1106
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,297
You look familiar.

1107
01:09:36,797 --> 01:09:38,507
Oh, yeah.

1108
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:40,384
The lady with the good potatoes.

1109
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:43,762
Where is Snow White?

1110
01:09:44,388 --> 01:09:45,389
Snow who?

1111
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:47,308
You're protecting her.

1112
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:49,143
Answer Her Majesty.

1113
01:10:07,912 --> 01:10:09,538
Show me where you found him.

1114
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:10,623
In the forest,

1115
01:10:10,664 --> 01:10:13,042
two furlongs south
of the crossroads.

1116
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:15,169
I'm sure you think you got this
licked, Your Majesty.

1117
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:16,670
But trust me,

1118
01:10:16,712 --> 01:10:19,131
you don't know what
you're up against.

1119
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:20,549
See, unlike you...

1120
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:23,177
I know her.

1121
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:26,347
I think you mean "knew."

1122
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:32,102
I think it's time
for Snow White and I

1123
01:10:32,978 --> 01:10:34,813

I don't like it.

1148
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:02,878
It's too dangerous with the
queen's guard out there looking
for you.

1149
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,004
We could come with you.

1150
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:05,381
Do you really have to go?

1151
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:07,966
I need to find the
truth about my father.

1152
01:13:08,008 --> 01:13:09,802
If there's any
chance he's alive...

1153
01:13:09,843 --> 01:13:12,012
And when you find
what you're looking for,

1154
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:13,472
you'll come back...

1155
01:13:14,848 --> 01:13:15,849
right?

1156
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:19,520
I will.

1157
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:20,938
I promise.

1158
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:28,821
Okay.

1159
01:13:29,321 --> 01:13:31,532
Come on, fellas. Let's go.

1160
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:15,784
Jonathan?

1161
01:14:20,372 --> 01:14:22,332
I'm sorry, my dear.

1162
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:24,960
Did I frighten you?

1163
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:28,046
No, I was expecting
someone else.

1164
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:31,550
Can I help you?

1165
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:33,343
It is I who can help you.

1166
01:14:33,927 --> 01:14:35,846
Are you Snow White?

1167
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:36,972
The princess?

1168
01:14:38,557 --> 01:14:39,975
Who did you say you were?

1169
01:14:40,017 --> 01:14:42,019
I have come with a message.

1170
01:14:42,936 --> 01:14:44,021
From Jonathan.

1171
01:14:44,771 --> 01:14:45,981
From Jonathan?

1172
01:14:46,690 --> 01:14:49,318
I'm afraid he's been captured
by the queen.

1173
01:14:50,235 --> 01:14:52,070
Captured? No.

1174
01:14:53,530 --> 01:14:56,158
He gave me this necklace.

1175
01:15:05,584 --> 01:15:07,794
He said you'd know
what it means.

1176
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:14,384
I need to go to him.

1177
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:18,555
But what of the danger?

1178
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:24,144
Ah. You love him?

1179
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:25,187
Well,

1180
01:15:25,771 --> 01:15:28,148
because love is so precious,

1181
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:31,109
I will help you.

1182
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:34,947
Here.

1183
01:15:35,948 --> 01:15:37,074
Take this apple

1184
01:15:37,115 --> 01:15:39,535
to sustain you on the road.

1185
01:15:45,123 --> 01:15:45,958
Hey!

1186
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:47,626
Whoa!

1187
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:58,554
Snow White.

1188
01:15:58,595 --> 01:16:03,183
I remember how generous your
father was to his people.

1189
01:16:04,142 --> 01:16:08,689
That's why it is an honor for me
to return the favor to his
daughter.

1190
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:11,108
I know I don't have
much to give...

1191
01:16:12,609 --> 01:16:15,988
but giving you this apple
makes me feel as though

1192
01:16:16,029 --> 01:16:17,990
his spirit is here.

1193
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:22,244
Come on! Hyah!

1194
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:30,002
Thank you.

1195
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:32,504
For him.

1196
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:34,673
For your father.

1197
01:16:37,634 --> 01:16:39,094
Hyah! Hyah!

1198
01:16:39,136 --> 01:16:41,138
-Go. Come on!
-Faster!

1199
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:01,992
What's happening?

1200
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:04,328
Something's wrong.

1201
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:06,580
I did know your father.

1202
01:17:08,957 --> 01:17:10,876
Quite well.

1203
01:17:12,836 --> 01:17:13,837
What do you mean?

1204
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:16,673
I knew he was a fool!

1205
01:17:16,715 --> 01:17:19,426
You. It's you.

1206
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:23,597
It was almost too easy for me
to have him killed.

1207
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:26,391
His goodness cost
him his throne,

1208
01:17:26,433 --> 01:17:29,436
as it will cost you your life.

1209
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:31,563
So...

1210
01:17:32,314 --> 01:17:34,900
tell me, Snow White...

1211
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:40,739
...who is the
fairest one of all?

1212
01:18:30,288 --> 01:18:34,292
Your envious heart can be at
rest.

1213
01:18:34,334 --> 01:18:37,337
You, my Queen,

1214
01:18:38,004 --> 01:18:40,632
are fairest of all.

1215
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:53,770
All hail the queen,

1216
01:18:54,438 --> 01:18:56,356
fairest of them all.

1217
01:20:40,043 --> 01:20:41,711
You've
done this every day.

1218
01:20:42,587 --> 01:20:43,588
It hasn't moved.

1219
01:20:51,888 --> 01:20:53,348
Forget it.

1220
01:20:56,434 --> 01:20:57,644
I did forget.

1221
01:20:59,938 --> 01:21:01,773
I forgot what it
was to have courage,

1222
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:04,025
to have hope, but then...

1223
01:21:05,485 --> 01:21:07,028
then I met Snow White.

1224
01:21:08,822 --> 01:21:10,115
She fought for us.

1225
01:21:11,032 --> 01:21:12,033
With us.

1226
01:21:13,660 --> 01:21:15,662
When she had every
reason to run.

1227
01:21:16,788 --> 01:21:18,415
She never gave up on us.

1228
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:22,043
I am not...

1229
01:21:23,086 --> 01:21:24,546
giving up on her.

1230
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:48,111
-Come on.
-Pull harder.

1231
01:21:58,663 --> 01:22:01,499
Listen, the queen's secret
entrance lets out one mile

1232
01:22:01,541 --> 01:22:03,960
from the royal stables
where there's dozens of horses.

1233
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:08,006
I'll check for guards. You go.

1234
01:22:08,632 --> 01:22:09,716
Good luck.

1235
01:22:15,221 --> 01:22:16,222
Whoa.

1236
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:02,185
I'm so sorry.

1237
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:08,835
Snow White...

1238
01:24:08,877 --> 01:24:11,463
-Ah.
-She's alive!

1239
01:24:11,504 --> 01:24:13,381
-She's awake.
-It's a miracle.

1240
01:24:24,392 --> 01:24:25,393
Jonathan.

1241
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:39,032
What is it?

1242
01:24:39,991 --> 01:24:41,284
Hey, what's wrong?

1243
01:24:43,369 --> 01:24:44,621
My father...

1244
01:24:46,456 --> 01:24:48,166
He's gone forever.

1245
01:24:51,544 --> 01:24:53,129
Murdered by the queen.

1246
01:24:59,302 --> 01:25:01,179
Oh, dear.

1247
01:25:02,847 --> 01:25:04,390

Time?

1264
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:28,057
Time to restore our kingdom.

1265
01:26:32,645 --> 01:26:34,189
It won't be easy.

1266
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:36,441
She'll do everything
she can to stop us.

1267
01:26:42,655 --> 01:26:43,907
Let her try.

1268
01:26:46,284 --> 01:26:47,952
Did he... Was that...

1269
01:26:47,994 --> 01:26:48,995
Dopey?

1270
01:26:49,495 --> 01:26:51,206
We're not afraid.

1271
01:26:51,247 --> 01:26:52,790
Dopey.

1272
01:26:52,832 --> 01:26:54,042
Not anymore.

1273
01:26:54,834 --> 01:26:55,877
Oh, wow.

1274
01:26:57,879 --> 01:26:59,547
Well said, Dopey.

1275
01:27:00,256 --> 01:27:01,507
Then neither am I.

1276
01:27:08,473 --> 01:27:09,515
Follow me.

1277
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:47,011
Shh!

1278
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:03,403

I believe you're looking for me.

1287
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:24,335
As a matter of fact,

1288
01:30:25,837 --> 01:30:28,548
I believe it is you
who's looking for me.

1289
01:30:29,090 --> 01:30:30,091
Stand aside.

1290
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:43,312
This is my father's house.

1291
01:30:46,732 --> 01:30:47,984
You killed him.

1292
01:30:50,319 --> 01:30:52,822
You stole it from
him, from all of us.

1293
01:30:57,034 --> 01:30:58,911
And now we're here
to take it back.

1294
01:31:04,917 --> 01:31:05,918
Pretty...

1295
01:31:06,752 --> 01:31:07,753
isn't she?

1296
01:31:12,049 --> 01:31:15,219
Delicate, elegant, exquisite.

1297
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:24,937
You think you want a flower.

1298
01:31:26,397 --> 01:31:28,274
But a flower wilts.

1299
01:31:29,817 --> 01:31:32,278
A flower cannot keep you safe.

1300
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:34,906
Or raise an army,

1301
01:31:34,947 --> 01:31:36,616
or lead a kingdom.

1302
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:40,077
A flower cannot give you
what I can give you.

1303
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:47,001
Perfection.

1304
01:31:48,961 --> 01:31:50,129
Power.

1305
01:31:52,048 --> 01:31:53,049
Beauty.

1306
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:07,230
If you want the throne...

1307
01:32:13,486 --> 01:32:14,529
take it.

1308
01:32:33,047 --> 01:32:34,215
They're waiting.

1309
01:32:45,935 --> 01:32:47,395
Enough of this charade.

1310
01:32:47,436 --> 01:32:49,063
Guards, hold her.

1311
01:32:49,730 --> 01:32:50,731
You.

1312
01:32:54,277 --> 01:32:56,362
Let the people watch her die.

1313
01:33:27,351 --> 01:33:28,352
Paul.

1314
01:33:34,817 --> 01:33:36,444
You were a farmer.

1315
01:33:37,987 --> 01:33:39,363
In the Western Vale.

1316
01:33:41,741 --> 01:33:43,075
You have a wife.

1317
01:33:44,452 --> 01:33:45,578
Eleanor.

1318
01:33:51,959 --> 01:33:54,879
You had a grove of cherry trees
and when they would blossom,

1319
01:33:54,920 --> 01:33:57,298
you would invite the village
to come and pick them.

1320
01:33:59,342 --> 01:34:00,593
To share them.

1321
01:34:03,554 --> 01:34:04,639
Matthew.

1322
01:34:05,556 --> 01:34:06,807
You were a baker...

1323
01:34:08,225 --> 01:34:09,644
just like your father.

1324
01:34:10,936 --> 01:34:13,564
You never turned anyone away
if they were hungry,

1325
01:34:13,606 --> 01:34:16,150
even if they didn't have
a coin left in their pocket.

1326
01:34:17,902 --> 01:34:18,861
Arthur.

1327
01:34:18,903 --> 01:34:19,904
Enough.

1328
01:34:19,945 --> 01:34:20,946
William.

1329
01:34:23,240 --> 01:34:24,742
I remember you.

1330
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:26,077
All of you.

1331
01:34:26,118 --> 01:34:27,411
I said, "Enough!"

1332
01:34:27,453 --> 01:34:29,622
There was a time where
we lived with hope.

1333
01:34:30,706 --> 01:34:33,292
When good things were nurtured
and allowed to grow.

1334
01:34:36,754 --> 01:34:37,922
I remember.

1335
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:42,677
Do you?

1336
01:34:51,185 --> 01:34:52,353
I remember.

1337
01:34:58,567 --> 01:34:59,568
I remember.

1338
01:35:01,904 --> 01:35:03,155
And I.

1339
01:35:05,908 --> 01:35:06,909
And I.

1340
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:11,080
And I.

1341
01:35:16,502 --> 01:35:17,503
Leave.

1342
01:35:18,671 --> 01:35:20,089
Now.

1343
01:35:20,131 --> 01:35:21,424
And never come back.

1344
01:35:31,225 --> 01:35:33,060
I am the rebel Quigg,

1345
01:35:33,686 --> 01:35:35,104
master of the crossbow.

1346
01:35:50,786 --> 01:35:53,414
No.

1347
01:35:56,584 --> 01:35:57,835
It isn't true.

1348
01:35:58,377 --> 01:36:01,672
Look at me. I'm
still the fairest.

1349
01:36:01,714 --> 01:36:04,091
Famed is thy beauty.

1350
01:36:04,133 --> 01:36:06,594
But it goes no
further than the skin.

1351
01:36:07,386 --> 01:36:09,305
For Snow White,

1352
01:36:09,346 --> 01:36:12,224
beauty comes from deep within.

1353
01:36:12,933 --> 01:36:14,435
And so, my Queen,

1354
01:36:14,477 --> 01:36:16,437
at last, you see.

1355
01:36:16,937 --> 01:36:19,482
She will always be

1356
01:36:19,523 --> 01:36:22,485
more fair than thee.

1357
01:36:22,526 --> 01:36:24,278
You lie!

1358
01:36:34,955 --> 01:36:39,210
Snow White
more fair than thee.

1359
01:37:51,866 --> 01:37:53,951
Once upon a time,

1360
01:37:53,993 --> 01:37:56,203
there was a peaceful kingdom

1361
01:37:56,245 --> 01:37:58,831
governed by a virtuous queen

1362
01:37:58,873 --> 01:38:01,709
who believed
that the true beauty of her land

1363
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:04,753
was not to be measured
in gems or jewels,

1364
01:38:05,379 --> 01:38:07,631
but in its people.

1365
01:38:07,673 --> 01:38:10,718
The queen ruled with
kindness and love.

1366
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:16,140
She was fearless,
fair, brave and true.

1367
01:38:17,516 --> 01:38:21,270
And her name was Snow White.
